The F.D.A.F Framework Custom Base Library Source
======================================================

If you want to add additional custom base API sources, you should work
within this directory. Keep the main `../base` untouched. You may add
i.e your own `/src/main/java/fadf/base/YourClass.java` file or so on.
The F.D.A.F framework `initializer` will combine your customized
sources with any other generated compilable sources.
